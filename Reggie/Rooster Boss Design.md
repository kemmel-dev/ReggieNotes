# Rooster Boss
## Concept
In Reggie, one of the bosses will be a lance carrying fellow (now called: antagonist) riding a rooster into battle. This battle will take place on a wide, flat surface. The rooster takes charge towards Reggie, whilst the antagonist hangs on and points his lance forwards. If Reggie hits this lance, he gets hurt. 

### Phase 1: Horizontal

 
In this phase, the combat takes place on a horizontal axis. Reggie has to make use of the drill powerup to hit the boss. The antagonist wears a Darth-vader like outfit with a cape. The rooster has armored plating across his body. This armor plating has the same color as the lance and shield the antagonist is carrying, indicating these are indestructible objects. The antagonist wears a different color, indicating that Reggie has to hit him, and not the rooster/shield.

The antagonist can hold his lance in five different positions. The screen is vertically seperated into four regions. We'll call these top, center-top, center-bottom and bottom respectively.

- Idle: Waits for the rooster to charge, pointing the lance upwards (and slightly backwards) to protect himself.

- High charge
	- top: Sits on top of the rooster, pointing the lance forwards and high, covering the top part of the screen.

	- center-top: Sits on top of the rooster, pointing the lance forwards, but slightly lower, covering the center-top part of the screen.

- Low charge
	- center-bottom: Hangs off of the rooster, pointing the lance forwards and high, covering the center-bottom part of the screen.

#### Gameplay loop
- Boss idles (in this state he is always turned towards Reggie)
- Reggie observes boss
- Boss takes charge towards Reggie, choosing one of four positions
- Reggie has to quickly adapt his position to be able to hit the boss
- Reggie either
	- Gets hit by boss
	- Hits the boss
	- Misses the boss
- Repeat


### Phase 2: Vertical
In this phase, the combat takes place on a vertical axis. Reggie loses his drill powerup, and cannot hit the antagonist from the front anymore. The antagonist however loses his helmet, creating a vulnerability on his head. Reggie has to make use of this vulnerability by hitting his head using his gravity switching move. 
In this phase, the rooster still has armored plating across his body. 

[[TODO]]: decide phase 2.
